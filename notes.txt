# Entities
$43 probably is rice ball

# Trivia
- Level #07 Actually has a seven on it
- I dont actually need to use Magic Capsule B to became invincible, just buy and equip it (but you cannot punch)


# Relação isOffScreenFlags e v_addedEntitiesShouldBeOffscreenXXXX
v_addedEntitiesShouldBeOffscreenHorizontally vai pra Entity.isOffScreenFlags.low
v_addedEntitiesShouldBeOffscreenVertically vai pra Entity.isOffScreenFlags.high

0xB81D é passagem em fase bonus


v_alexActionState is 7 on bike, 9 on peticopter and 2 when invincible
